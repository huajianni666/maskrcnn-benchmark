This project aims at providing the necessary building blocks for easily
creating detection and segmentation models using PyTorch 1.0.

## Highlights
- **PyTorch 1.0:** RPN, Faster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN implementations that matches or exceeds Detectron accuracies
- **Very fast**: up to **2x** faster than [Detectron](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron) and **30%** faster than [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) during training. See [MODEL_ZOO.md](MODEL_ZOO.md) for more details.
- **Memory efficient:** uses roughly 500MB less GPU memory than mmdetection during training
- **Multi-GPU training and inference**
- **Batched inference:** can perform inference using multiple images per batch per GPU
- **CPU support for inference:** runs on CPU in inference time. See our [webcam demo](demo) for an example
- Provides pre-trained models for almost all reference Mask R-CNN and Faster R-CNN configurations with 1x schedule.


## Installation

Check [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for installation instructions.


## Model Zoo and Baselines

Pre-trained models, baselines and comparison with Detectron and mmdetection
can be found in [MODEL_ZOO.md](MODEL_ZOO.md)

## Inference in a few lines
We provide a helper class to simplify writing inference pipelines using pre-trained models.
Here is how we would do it. Run this from the `demo` folder:
```python
from maskrcnn_benchmark.config import cfg
from predictor import COCODemo

config_file = "../configs/caffe2/e2e_mask_rcnn_R_50_FPN_1x_caffe2.yaml"

# update the config options with the config file
cfg.merge_from_file(config_file)
# manual override some options
cfg.merge_from_list(["MODEL.DEVICE", "cpu"])

coco_demo = COCODemo(
    cfg,
    min_image_size=800,
    confidence_threshold=0.7,
)
# load image and then run prediction
image = ...
predictions = coco_demo.run_on_opencv_image(image)
```

## Perform training on COCO dataset

For the following examples to work, you need to first install `maskrcnn_benchmark`.

You will also need to download the COCO dataset.
We recommend to symlink the path to the coco dataset to `datasets/` as follows

We use `minival` and `valminusminival` sets from [Detectron](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron/blob/master/detectron/datasets/data/README.md#coco-minival-annotations)

```bash
# symlink the coco dataset
cd ~/github/maskrcnn-benchmark
mkdir -p datasets/coco
ln -s /path_to_coco_dataset/annotations datasets/coco/annotations
ln -s /path_to_coco_dataset/train2014 datasets/coco/train2014
ln -s /path_to_coco_dataset/test2014 datasets/coco/test2014
ln -s /path_to_coco_dataset/val2014 datasets/coco/val2014
# for pascal voc dataset:
ln -s /path_to_VOCdevkit_dir datasets/voc
```

You can also configure your own paths to the datasets.
For that, all you need to do is to modify `maskrcnn_benchmark/config/paths_catalog.py` to
point to the location where your dataset is stored.
You can also create a new `paths_catalog.py` file which implements the same two classes,
and pass it as a config argument `PATHS_CATALOG` during training.

### Single GPU training
[Mask R-CNN R-101 FPN model](http://pbhx6ce5l.bkt.clouddn.com/resnet101-fpn-mask.zip),[Mask R-CNN R-50 FPN model](http://pbhx6ce5l.bkt.clouddn.com/resnet50-fpn-mask.zip),[Mask R-CNN R-18 FPN model](http://pbhx6ce5l.bkt.clouddn.com/resnet18-fpn-mask.zip)
Here is an example for Mask R-CNN R-50 FPN distillation Mask R-CNN R-18 FPN with the 1x schedule:
```bash
python tools/train_distillation_net.py --local_rank 0 --teacher-config-file configs/e2e_mask_rcnn_R_50_FPN_1x.yaml --student-config-file configs/e2e_mask_rcnn_R_18_FPN_1x.yaml

```
This follows the [scheduling rules from Detectron.](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron/blob/master/configs/getting_started/tutorial_1gpu_e2e_faster_rcnn_R-50-FPN.yaml#L14-L30)
Note that we have multiplied the number of iterations by 8x (as well as the learning rate schedules),
and we have divided the learning rate by 8x.

We also changed the batch size during testing, but that is generally not necessary because testing
requires much less memory than training.


### No support Multi-GPU training because the teacher model has been setting "no_grad", pytorch bug


## Abstractions
For more information on some of the main abstractions in our implementation, see [ABSTRACTIONS.md](ABSTRACTIONS.md).

## Adding your own dataset

This implementation adds support for COCO-style datasets.
But adding support for training on a new dataset can be done as follows:
```python
from maskrcnn_benchmark.structures.bounding_box import BoxList

class MyDataset(object):
    def __init__(self, ...):
        # as you would do normally

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        # load the image as a PIL Image
        image = ...

        # load the bounding boxes as a list of list of boxes
        # in this case, for illustrative purposes, we use
        # x1, y1, x2, y2 order.
        boxes = [[0, 0, 10, 10], [10, 20, 50, 50]]
        # and labels
        labels = torch.tensor([10, 20])

        # create a BoxList from the boxes
        boxlist = BoxList(boxes, image.size, mode="xyxy")
        # add the labels to the boxlist
        boxlist.add_field("labels", labels)

        if self.transforms:
            image, boxlist = self.transforms(image, boxlist)

        # return the image, the boxlist and the idx in your dataset
        return image, boxlist, idx

    def get_img_info(self, idx):
        # get img_height and img_width. This is used if
        # we want to split the batches according to the aspect ratio
        # of the image, as it can be more efficient than loading the
        # image from disk
        return {"height": img_height, "width": img_width}
```
That's it. You can also add extra fields to the boxlist, such as segmentation masks
(using `structures.segmentation_mask.SegmentationMask`), or even your own instance type.

For a full example of how the `COCODataset` is implemented, check [`maskrcnn_benchmark/data/datasets/coco.py`](maskrcnn_benchmark/data/datasets/coco.py).

### Note:
While the aforementioned example should work for training, we leverage the
cocoApi for computing the accuracies during testing. Thus, test datasets
should currently follow the cocoApi for now.

## Finetuning from Detectron weights on custom datasets
Create a script `tools/trim_detectron_model.py` like [here](https://gist.github.com/wangg12/aea194aa6ab6a4de088f14ee193fd968).
You can decide which keys to be removed and which keys to be kept by modifying the script.

Then you can simply point the converted model path in the config file by changing `MODEL.WEIGHT`.
